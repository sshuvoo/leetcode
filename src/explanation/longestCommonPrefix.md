# Explanations

This code efficiently iterates through the strings, progressively shortening the prefix until it matches all strings or becomes empty. It returns the longest common prefix found among the strings in the array.

I made line-by-line explanations - So first try to understand the problem.

# Solve (TypeScript)

```ts
function longestCommonPrefix(strs: string[]): string {
   // Initialize with the first string in the array
   let prefix: string = strs[0];
   while (true) {
      // Check if every string in the array starts with the current prefix
      const isfound = strs.every((str) => str.startsWith(prefix));
      if (isfound) break;
      // If the prefix is not found in all strings,
      // shorten the prefix by removing the last character
      else prefix = prefix.slice(0, prefix.length - 1);
   }
   return prefix;
}
```

# Solve (JavaScript)

```ts
function longestCommonPrefix(strs) {
   let prefix = strs[0];
   while (true) {
      const isfound = strs.every((str) => str.startsWith(prefix));
      if (isfound) break;
      else prefix = prefix.slice(0, prefix.length - 1);
   }
   return prefix;
}
```
